	<h4><u>About Jagannath University</u></h4>
          <p>As the educational activities of the College expanded, expectations of the mass people, students and teachers about Jagannath started increasing simultaneously. At one stage, it was demanded to transform the college into a full-fledged autonomous university. Though on Nov. 2, 1995, it was declared as a University, it was not activated even many years after. Time to time students kept their movement continuing to activate this declaration. At last, after a long 9 years, on November 06, 2004, in the ECNEC meeting Jagannath University Project was approved. On March 2, 2005, the then Principal of Jagannath College Prof. Ayesha Shirin Rahman was appointed as the Director of the project. To cope up with the global trend of the competitive world and to improve quality of teaching, learning and research in the field of higher education nationally i.e. to change the landscape of higher education through enhancement of quality of higher education and research the Jagannath University Act was approved by the parliament on 27 September 2005 by transforming Jagannath Government College into a university, and in that same year on October 20, by a Government notification the dream of a full-fledged university came into being. After that with the appointment of Prof. Sirajul Islam Khan as the first Vice-Chancellor of the university on February 08, 2006, the journey of a full-fledged university began.
Faculties, Institutes and Departments Government Jagannath College under four Faculties (Arts, Sciences, Commerce, and Social Sciences, Session 2005-06) started its journey with twenty departments in the name of Jagannath University. Faculty of Arts, included Bengali, English, History, History and Culture of Islam, Islamic Studies, Philosophy Department Faculty of Business Studies included Accounting and Management Department; in faculty of Science was comprised of Botany, Chemistry, Geography & Environment, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Zoology Department and Faculty of Social Sciences included Economics, Social Science, Social Work Department.
After that, from 2006-07 academic session Finance and Marketing Department were included in the Faculty of Business Studies. Again from 2008-09 academic session Anthropology and Mass Communication & Journalism Departments were introduced under the Faculty of Social Sciences and Department of Law was included under the Faculty of Arts. Since March 13, 2010 the name of Accounting and Management Department was changed into Department of Accounting and Information Systems and Department Management Studies respectively. From 2009-10 Faculty of Science included the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology and Department of Pharmacy. From the academic year 2012-13, the Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology was renamed as Department of Microbiology.
On the June 22, 2011, according to the decision of the 15th Academic Council and according to the 39th Syndicate Meeting of 27th June, Department of Law was included in Faculty of Law; Department of Chemistry, Department of Mathematics, Department of Physics, Department of Statistics, and Department Of Computer Science included in the Faculty of Science and Department of Botany, Department of Geography & Environment, Department of Psychology, Department of Zoology, Department of Microbiology, and Department of Biotechnology and Pharmacy were included in the Faculty of Life and Earth Sciences. From July, 2010 Centre for English Language, from 2013-14 under the Faculty of Arts Drama and Music, Fine Arts and Graphics Department, under the Faculty of Social Sciences Department of Public Administration and from 2015-16 academic year Film and Television Department started their academic activities.

On April 16, 2015, the name of the Fine Arts and Graphics Department was changed to Fine Arts Department and from 2016-17 academic year the Music Department was separated from Drama and Music Dept and two separate departments started in the names of Music Department and Drama Department. From the 2017-18 academic year the Centre for English Language was abolished and Institute of Modern Languages (IML) started. M.Phil and Ph.D programmes started from the academic year 2012-13.
The BNP government wanted to build up the Jagannath College in a Private University model. Because five years after the establishment, bearing its own cost was totally like a private organization. From this side its Act was faulty and against the principles of a public university. In 2011, our present Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's steps made it fully a Public University.
In the first Convocation of Jagannath University (bearing its history of one hundred and fifty years), If we are to realize the importance properly, we have to carry its history on. In the past Jagannath had an active role to play in each economical-social and cultural activity. And still it has to. Dhaka University is called the womb of Bengali Nationalism and Jagannath is focused as its life flow. In the past, the teachers were not only extraordinary in wisdom and knowledge, but they were the forerunners of all kinds of intellectual achievements. Following this history and tradition, the Jagannath has been able to be one of the best educational institutions in the country.
